# Silicon Labs Platform #

Our energy-friendly EFM32 and EFR32 microcontrollers (MCUs) are ideal for ultra-low power applications. Based on ARM® Cortex® -M0+, Cortex-M3, and Cortex-M4 cores, our 32-bit MCUs extend battery life for those "hard-to-reach", power-sensitive consumer and industrial applications. Engineered for low power and intelligent design, our MCUs can scale power consumption while still performing real-time embedded tasks.
