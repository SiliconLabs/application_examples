# Silicon Labs Bluetooth #

Silicon Labs' Bluetooth chipsets deliver high performance, low energy and easy-to-use Bluetooth solutions integrated into a small form factor package. The ultra-low power operating modes and fast wake-up times of the Silicon Labs' energy-friendly 32-bit MCUs, combined with the low transmit and receive power consumption of the Bluetooth radio, result in a solution optimized for battery-powered applications.
