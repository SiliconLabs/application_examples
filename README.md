# Silicon Labs Application Examples #

This repo contains example applications developed by Silicon Labs engineers for EFM32 and EFR32 devices. These examples are categorized by technology. All examples provide a .sls file to easily import into Simplicity Studio. Additionally, each example will provide the source files and instructions to port the example to other parts. Unless otherwise specified in the directory, all examples are considered to be EXPERIMENTAL QUALITY which implies that the code provided in the repos has not been formally tested and is provided as-is.  It is not suitable for production environments.  In addition, this code will not be maintained and there may be no bug maintenance planned for these resources. Silicon Labs may update projects from time to time.

## Table of Contents ##

## Reporting Bugs/Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##

To report bugs in the peripheral example projects, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.  Please reference the board, project, and source files associated with the bug, and reference line numbers.  If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix.  Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.

## Disclaimer ##

The Gecko SDK suite supports development with Silicon Labs IoT SoC and module devices. Unless otherwise specified in the specific directory, all examples are considered to be EXPERIMENTAL QUALITY which implies that the code provided in the repos has not been formally tested and is provided as-is.  It is not suitable for production environments.  In addition, this code will not be maintained and there may be no bug maintenance planned for these resources.
